# Registration Form

This is a Python-based GUI registration form built using `tkinter`. The form allows users to input their personal details such as First Name, Last Name, Email, Password, and Date of Birth. It includes input validation for each field.

## Features
- **First Name** and **Last Name**: Requires alphabetic characters only.
- **Email**: Validates input using regular expressions.
- **Password**: Minimum length of 8 characters, with matching password confirmation.
- **Date of Birth**: Drop-down menus for selecting day, month, and year.
- Final validation displays success or error messages.

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.x recommended).
2. Install `tkinter` if it's not already available:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install python3-tk  # For Ubuntu/Debian
